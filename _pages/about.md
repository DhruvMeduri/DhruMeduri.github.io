 I am Dhruv Meduri, a first year PhD student in the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah being advised by <a href='http://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/'>  Prof. Bei Wang</a>. My research interests lie in the design and analysis of algorithms in geometry and topology. Specifically, I am interested in pursuing areas such as Computational Topology, Topological Data Analysis(TDA) and Computational Geometry along with their applications in Machine Learning and Visualization.
